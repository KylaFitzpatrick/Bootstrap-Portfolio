          My name is Kyla Fitzpatrick. I was born in San Francisco, CA on March 26, 1991.
          I grew up in a small little town hippie town called Mill Valley located in Northern California.
          I lived in Mill Valley until I started college at Sonoma State Univeristy.
          I decided I wanted to explore the world outside of California, so I moved to the East coast to
          live with my grandpa in Northern Virgina. I attended community college there for about a year and then 
          I transferred to University of North Carolina at Carlotte. During my time there, I studied
          abroad in Barcelona and graduated with a BSBA in International Business.
        </p>
        <p>Shortly after graduating, I landed an internship as a Release Coordinator at a hedge fund company.
          After my internship ended, I was hired back as a Junior QA Analyst. Since then, I moved back to the 
          Bay Area for a bit before moving to Austin, Texas for 3 years. My hobbies include spending time with 
          family and friends. I enjoy traveling, camping and listening to all kinds of music, but my favorite
          genre is indie. I love attending concerts and festivals especially Austin City Limits.
